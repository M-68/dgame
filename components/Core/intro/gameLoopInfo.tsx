        Our game offers a unique and engaging experience that combines the excitement of gaming with scientific knowledge.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        By playing, you can actively contribute to scientific research by classifying objects based on real-world data. The current focus is on the planets mini-game, where you can help identify potential new planets discovered by the TESS telescope.

      <p className="mb-4">
        To start playing, sign up & create an account. Once you have logged in, you will be redirected to our training program, where we teach you how to play.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Once complete, you will have the ability to navigate to the planets page where you'll classify different objects with relevant information to help you make informed decisions.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The more you classify, the more items you collect, and the more items you collect, the more planets you can colonize. You can earn points that can be redeemed for rewards and recognition within the Star Sailors community. This is also where you can create posts about your decisions and invite other users to vote on your assessments.
