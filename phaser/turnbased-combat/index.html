Game Narrative
6 planets:
1. Ice (think Hoth/Interstellar)
    1. Very little fauna. Some semi-intelligent (think Thi-Sen from SW) but very little intelligent life from other systems. Minor space port with automated research facility. 
    2. Flora lives in a symbiotic relationship with the fauna
2. Scorched (Mustafar)
3. Swamp planet
4. Desert planet (tidally locked, both types of deserts)
5. Lush planet
6. Megacity planet (see Unity Megacities demo, or Coruscant. Was probably an amalgamation of the above biomes before being terraformed into a Megacity. This is the planet with the most visible destruction (caused by the underlining storyline))

Some key rules for the planets:
* There is always a level of flora and fauna - no deserted planets
* There is always an important symbiotic relationship between flora and fauna on a planet, this relationship helps to display the “balance”
* All the planets have some form of “human contact” with at the very least a minimal space port


Spacesuit:
* Scanners
* Computer system connecting to ships & galactic network

Different spaceship designs depending on each planet (therefore which species made it, materials, etc). But roughly they’ll be divided into a couple of main types with the following attributes:
* Rough shape
* Dimensions
* Capacity (in the cockpit)
* Extra passengers?
* Weapons & weapon classes
* Other attributes from NMS & cool SW ships

There will also be freighters which can be docked with ships, and themselves dock into space station (sort of like the Nexus in NMS). Freighters are based around corporations like in Eve. Can have unlimited ships. 

Species: names and attributes inspired by things like NMS or Master of Orion, but also the original manuscript I had (I’ll provide links to that)

Sandbox elements: screenshots as paintings (e.g. Minecraft base, maybe we can generate stuff later on from those uploads), spaceship customisation with custom items (which can themselves have custom images and attributes), integration with sandbox.gg?
* Also we can have a player economy based on the megacity planet with outposts on other planets and spaceships (like Eve Online corporations), which links back in to the online marketplace service


Add roguelike (dead cells ) rpg character progression


What will come in future updates?
* Moons
* More planets
* etc.
